# Align-scan
# 🖐️ Hand Scanner using Live Camera with MediaPipe & OpenCV

A real-time hand detection system that uses **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe** to scan a hand via your computer's webcam. Once the hand is perfectly aligned inside a transparent hand template on-screen, a **video is automatically played**.
